# Hiking Mt. Sentinel

This past weekend I decided to be a crazy outdoors guy and go for a good solid
hike. I started out hiking the "M" trail and figured I'd call it quits there or
maybe a bit above (chubby kids from the midwest have to ease into this stuff).

Curiosity got the better of me and I kept going. Here are some nifty pictures.
Someday I'll have a phone with a fancy camera on it, but until then the
pictures will be low quality.

First up, taken on my way up to the "M".

Next, just past the "M" looking north-ish to the Rattlesnake area.

Obligatory self-deprecating picture of myself.

I found a creepy cave somewhere along the way. I might move in this spring.

Making it to the trees was exciting. I love the smell.

Lonely dead tree. Beyond is (I think) East Missoula and the Clark Fork heading east.

This is as far as I got. Almost to the top. I'll bring more water next time. Pretty impressive view either way. I love the mountains.
