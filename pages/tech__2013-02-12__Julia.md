# Julia

Julia (<http://julialang.org>) is a relatively new language designed for
scientific and technical computing. I have an interest in this area so I've been
playing around with it. I'm a pretty regular user of the R language, as well as
Python and if Julia lives up to its goals it will be able to replace both of
these for numerical and statistical work.

At the moment, the language is under heavy development so things break regularly
(but get fixed quickly) and generally change under you more often than I would
like. I'm taking a course in simulation and modeling this semester and my goal
is to code some of the assignments in Julia (in addition to the Python versions
required for the course). This will give me a great way to learn how to do
things efficiently in Julia (for example, loops are apparently preferred over
vectorized operations in at least some cases in Julia) while letting me do some
naive benchmarks of my own for comparison.
