# Using Python on Windows

With Python being used more and more outside of a traditional software
development environment, its use on Windows is probably more important than it
once was since, like it or not (I don't, hehe) Windows is still widely used
outside of the software development community. With that in mind, here are a few
Windows-compatible tools for developing Python programs.

  * [PyScripter](https://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/) - an open source Python
    IDE that allows the user to interact with running code more easily than most
    other tools. This is handy for debugging, but also for interactive use,
    which is common in the scientific community.
  * [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/) - not strictly a Python tool,
    this is the quintessential Windows text editor. A massive, massive upgrade
    from the editor bundled with Windows (hence the name), it is handy for
    anyone writing code on Windows.
  * [Winpdb](http://winpdb.org/about/) - a Python debugger that presents a
    friendly GUI. It requires a bit of work to install on Windows, but can be
    quite useful.
  * [IPython](http://ipython.org/) - one of the most useful Python tools ever,
    IPython is, at its core, a huge upgrade to the built-in REPL (interpreter)
    that adds features like tab-completion (hit tab to see available methods,
    names, and more). It also includes IPython Notebook, a browser-based
    interactive computing environment for writing documents that mix prose and
    code.
  * [bugjar](http://pybee.org/bugjar/) - a nice, cross-platform GUI debugger.
    Part of the BeeWare suite of applications and libraries that seek to make
    Python easier for developers.
  * [toga](http://pybee.org/toga/) - a cross-platform GUI toolkit for creating
    user interfaces that will work, natively, across multiple platforms (Mac,
    Windows, Linux).
