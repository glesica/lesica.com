  * 6.5-7.5 cup flour
  * 2 pkg / 2 tbl yeast
  * 0.5 cup sugar
  * 2 tsp salt
  * 1 cup milk
  * 1 cup water

#### Topping

  * 0.5 cup packed brown sugar
  * 4 tbl cinnamon
  * 4 tbl sugar
  * 4 tbl butter

### Directions

#### Prepare Dough

  * Preheat oven to 375 F.
  * In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cup flour, yeast, 0.5 cup sugar and salt. Mix well.
  * In a saucepan, heat milk, water and 0.5 cup butter until warm (120-130 F). The butter does not need to melt.
  * Add liquid and eggs to the flour mixture.
  * Blend at low speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes at medium speed.
  * Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough.
  * Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, 5-8 minutes.
  * Place dough in a greased bowl, turn to grease top of dough.
  * Cover and let rise in a warm place until dough has doubled. About 1 hour.

#### Prepare Filling

  * Combine brown sugar, sugar and cinnamon.
  * Set aside.

#### Finish Dough

  * Punch down dough.
  * On a lightly floured surface, roll two 15x12 inch rectangles.
  * Spread with softened butter.
  * Sprinkle filling over dough.
  * Starting with the short side, roll up tightly and pinch the edge to seal.
  * Cut each roll into 12 slices.
  * Place slices into two greased 13x9 inch pans.
  * Let rise in a warm place until double. About 30 minutes.
  * Bake at 375 F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.

For extra yummy, drizzle unsalted butter over the top, then more cinnamon and sugar, before baking.
