# *buntu 12.10 is Out

Looking forward to a fancy upgrade. I might give Unity another try, but maybe
not. [Xubuntu](http://www.xubuntu.org) has served me well, so I might stick
with that.

Frankly, the best thing about Xubuntu is that it doesn't come with a ton of
bloat. No LibreOffice, for example, which is absolutely pointless for me (it
does come with Abiword and Gnumeric, which is sort of ironic since those
are/were the core tools in the "Gnome Office Suite").
