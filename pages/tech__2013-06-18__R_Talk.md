# R Talk

Over the past couple weeks I've given two introductory talks on the R
statistical computing environment. The target audience was basically people who
already know one or more programming languages and are interesting in using R to
enhance work they already do. If you're interested, you can check out the slides
and sample code on Github: <https://github.com/glesica/r-talk/>.
