# Ubuntu / Linux Mint Audio Bug

**Update:** Apparently this bug can affect Linux Mint 14 as well (I just
encountered it). The fix is the same.

Ubuntu 12.10 and Linux Mint 14 (which I use because Unity is a steaming pile of
garbage) have a bug related to audio on new Thinkpads (I just got a T430s,
really happy with it so far, thanks for asking).

Anyway,
[apparently](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/1066437)
the speakers stop working if the computer is suspended while the wireless is
enabled. Yeah, convoluted, but why not, right?

Anyway, after reading through the bug report and comments, I found
[another](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1064621) bug
report with a similar problem. It's not entirely clear that they are the same
issue, but whatever.

There are a couple suggestions listed there. I always try the least-invasive
solution first. In this case that meant disabling "Automute mode".

    $ alsamixer

That will bring up a fun terminal application that lets you adjust audio
settings and such. Scroll to the right with the arrow keys until you find
"Auto-Mute" and change it to "Disabled" using the Up/Down arrow keys.

Win.
