# Weird Bug at GNP

Saw a bunch of these odd little bugs in our campsite at Glacier
National Park last week. This one landed on my pant leg as I was
sitting in a camp chair. I gently popped him on to the ground but he
didn't move after that. I'm not sure if I accidentally killed him or
if he was freaked out and just making like a tree.
