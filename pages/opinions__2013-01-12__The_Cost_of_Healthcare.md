# The Cost of Healthcare

People often talk about the fact that single-payer ("socialized") healthcare
would necessitate a tax increase. But would we really end up paying more than we
already do? Ultimately I don't really care where my money goes, provided I get
something I want in return and the value I get is acceptable. At the moment,
healthcare costs in the US are highly distributed. In other words, we pay
in a wide variety of ways, some more unexpected than others.

One interesting way we pay is in school tuition. Most people who have health
insurance in the US are provided coverage through an employer. Obviously, this
avenue isn't usually available for full-time students, of which I am one.

I took a look at my tuition bill for the coming semester today. I was amazed at
how much of the bill goes toward healthcare services. If the government provided
healthcare to everyone then the relative cost of going to school would be lower.
First (and maybe foremost) the opportunity cost would be lower, since students
wouldn't have to sacrifice decent healthcare (the insurance I pay dearly for is
pretty lousy). Second, the direct cost of attending school would be lower since
healthcare services wouldn't have to be bundled with tuition.
