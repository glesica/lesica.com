# Vim Plugins

I decided to finally configure Pathogen and go through my Vim plugins to add
some useful ones and remove some that I don't use regularly. There were quite a
few popular and useful plugins that I didn't have installed (including Pathogen)
and a couple that I had installed but never used.

Here's a list of what I'm using now:
