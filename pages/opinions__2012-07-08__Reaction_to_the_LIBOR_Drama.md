# Reaction to the LIBOR Drama

The Economist has a [good article](http://www.economist.com/node/21558281?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/the_rotten_heart_of_finance) 
about the LIBOR scandal. The most shocking thing to me, personally, 
wasn't that investment bankers had put short-term profits ahead of 
professional ethics, social welfare, the law and the long-term health 
of their respective companies, but other companies had actually 
trusted the LIBOR for business dealings.

I realize that not everyone is as cynical as I am, but once again, 
it's all about the incentives. If Banker A has an incentive 
to manipulate Index Q, and is put in charge (at least partially) 
of computing Index Q, then responsible people must immediately 
assume that Banker A will manipulate Index Q and cease to rely 
on the accuracy or impartiality of Index Q. To do anything different 
is just irresponsible.
