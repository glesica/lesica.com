# Can They Both Lose?

So, Obama and Romney are both pretty terrible, huh? But don't think
this is the usual "pick the lesser of two evils, that's America"
drivel, it's not. I
really, really despise both of these individuals, and there's nothing
"American" about it. Here's why.

## Obama

Change we can believe in, huh? Change, like
[assassinating](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html) American
citizens,
[appointing](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/04/biden-to-mpaa-youll-like-obamas-copyright-pick/)
[Hollywood](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/01/obama-nominates-former-riaa-lawyer-for-solicitor-general-spot/) 
to run copyright policy for the
administration,
and [hunting](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/business/media/white-house-uses-espionage-act-to-pursue-leak-cases-media-equation.html)
down whistleblowers after promising a transparent administration. Need
I go on?

That's enough for me. Nevermind not closing Gitmo, and letting
Iraq and Afghanistan drag on. His mishandling of the healthcare debate
is just icing on the cake (I personally favor a decent single-payer
plan).

Will the country come to an end if Obama is reelected?
Absolutely not. But he needs to be punished for so thoroughly
abandoning the people who supported him.

## Romney

My dislike of Romney is a little more subtle since he hasn't actually
been the president, so he has no "record" to criticize. Of course this
more or less embodies who he sems to be: a fake.

For example, from his [campaign web
site](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/tax):

  > In approaching the nation's fiscal challenges, President Obama has
  > repeatedly called for a "balanced approach," by which he means
  > cutting spending but also raising taxes. That may sound appealing
  > on the surface. However, the reality is that before President
  > Obama exploded the size of the federal government, our existing
  > tax rates were more or less adequate to pay for the government we
  > needed.

OK, first of all, what he's saying is that we should bring back Clinton? Because
that was the last time our budget was balanced.

He says he wants a tax system that is more "fair", but he seems to
think it is perfectly fair for capital to be taxed at a lower rate
than labor. That isn't fair in my book.

He says he wants the tax system to encourage entrepreneurs, but that
seems to be code for "lower taxes for the wealthy". But those two
groups don't actually correlate. In fact, a single-payer healthcare
system would probably do more to encourage entrepreneurs than a
relatively small reduction in the highest marginal tax rate by
lowering the risk associated with starting a new business.

**Update:** I almost forgot to mention gay marriage! Full legal rights for gays,
lesbians and other individuals with non-heterosexual orientations is, in my
opinion, the defining civil rights issue of our generation. Anyone who does not
support full legal rights for these individuals should not be elected to a
student council, let alone to the presidency.

Romney fails this test miserably and his campaign is too cowardly to even name
the issue. The word "gay" does not appear on the site and the discussion of gay
marriage is hidden at the bottom of the page titled "Values".

  > Marriage is more than a personally rewarding social custom. It is also
  > critical for the well-being of a civilization. That is why it is so
  > important to preserve traditional marriage - the joining together of one man
  > and one woman. As president, Mitt will not only appoint an Attorney General
  > who will defend the Defense of Marriage Act - a bipartisan law passed by
  > Congress and signed by President Clinton - but he will also champion a
  > Federal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution defining marriage as between
  > one man and one woman.

## Conclusion

I really don't want either of these men to be president. I don't trust
either of them to make good decisions, and I don't trust either of
them to improve life for myself and the majority of other Americans.

So what to do?

I don't know. I guess I could vote for someone random, or I could
throw a shoe at one or both of the candidates. But really, there just isn't
anything I can do, and *that* is decidedly un-American.
