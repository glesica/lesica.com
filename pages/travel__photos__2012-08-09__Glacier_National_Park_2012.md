# Glacier National Park - 2012

Visited GNP last week. Pretty amazing, even given the rather warm
weather. There was less snow than the last time I was there in August,
2008 so it was a pretty different experience. Jen and I did the Hidden
Lake trail but the second half was closed due to "bear danger".  We
did about 1/3 of the Highline trail as well.

Here's Jenny standing in front of one of the sub-alpine meadows near
the middle of the Hidden Lake trail. If she'd had a book with her she
might have just curled up on a rock and spent a few hours reading.
