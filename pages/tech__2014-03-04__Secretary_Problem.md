# Secretary Problem

The [Secretary Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem) was
highlighted on Hacker News the other day and I found it pretty interesting. I
enjoy simulating algorithms with random properties, I think it helps build
understanding, but it's also just "neat" when things work out the way they're
supposed to work out.

Here's a quick Julia program that will simulate the problem several times and
track the results. You will notice that the results come out just as the
Wikipedia article says they should.
